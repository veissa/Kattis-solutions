Bergur is a very good programmer and has extensive knowledge of most of the world’s programming languages. When Bergur programs he never makes any mistakes and thus never has to change what he has written. He however has the bad habit of writing all of his code on a single line. There is one programming language that only Bergur can handle, no other programmer has attained the understanding required to make use of it. This programming language was naturally designed by Bergur himself.

Now all the world’s programmers are trying to figure out how you program in BergMál, so they have worked together to put a keylogger on Bergur’s computer. The keylogger then sends back what keys Bergur presses and in what order. Can you take the info that the keylogger sent and rewrite Bergur’s code in BergMál?
Input

A single line with the info that the keylogger sent. The keylogger sends at least one character and at most
characters.
